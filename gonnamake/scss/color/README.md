#Colors
The colors in web design is very important. Any web design consists of 2 to 5. Where white, blue and black are not considered as colors. All majors use this as a basic rules.


White in the background. Black for text. Blue for link. Web color is done. Color desides the value of the brand. 
Take Apple Computers Machintosh they can produced in 90's. It was the first iMac which set a new brand to the world of colors.
Later when they desided to produce iPod. Think what would have have happened to apple if they use blue like facebook.

##Blue

###Facebook Blue
Facebook is used by many people because of it's color. Blue, Black and White. What do you remember when people talk about facebook. It's a blue world.

###Google Blue
Blue doesn't disturb eyes. When we take the example of .
Google Blue is used in google search engine. It was adopted by Bing for testing and they found that google blue generated more clicks that what Bing used as there default blue.

##Twitter
Twitter colors are the same colors used in twitter. Altought the colors are amazing they are not unique. If you use bootstrap colors people don't give value to your product as it is used in millions of other websites. Whenever they see your product they initially think that you have copied other design. Which means you can't create your own product. When both design as well as the color are similar. Change design.


##To Do
+ Using the colors which are most popular and which people seen by people.
+ Use colors which are friendly to users eyes. Which makes UI ellivate better.


##Colors Archictecture
+ 1-2 Primary and Secondary colors are used.
+ The support colors are White, Black and Blue.
+ Secondary colors are Red, Green, Yellow and Green used for Failure,Sucess,Warning and Info.
+ Rearly used colors are Purple, Brown, Pink, etc. This depends on the design
+ Darkness and Lightness
+ Colors selected in palatte should be of same saturation. They can differ but very slightly.

Here are some things to keep in mind when planning the colour scheme for your website. Remember that there are always some superb exceptions to the rule (see 13), so don't be afraid to experiment...

1.    Contrast. Background colour should be a single wash and have plenty of contrast with the text. Black - or dark grey – text against a white background remains the most sensible option.

2.    Avoid patterns behind text. This is the main problem with many of those user-customised MySpace profiles.

3.    Links. I firmly believe that links should be coloured blue, largely because the web’s most popular websites typically use blue (Google, Yahoo, BBC, New York Times, eBay, etc). Why reinvent the wheel?

4.    Clicked links. The vast majority of websites change the colour of a visited link to help users navigate. So should you. Maroon is a common choice for clicked links. Avoid applying these settings to your primary navigation.

5.    Limit your colour choices. The consensus opinion with regards to colour and web design seems to be one of ‘the fewer the better’. Use colour sparingly if you want it to grab the eye. Colour can be persuasive, but not if it is lost among a rainbow.

6.    Shades. Many websites use a blend of neutral colours and a range of shades of their main colour choice/s. This is easier on the eye than trying to work with multiple primary colours. I’m currently a big fan of grey. Note that some people struggle to pick out differing shades of blue.

7.    Add 30% more white space. By spacing out content units and blocks of colour you’ll help guide the eye to key areas. I’d wager that lightly-coloured landing pages with one brightly coloured ‘buy now’ button will convert better than a page featuring a mess of colour. Make that button stand out! Go on, try it…

8.    Be ‘web safe’. Macs and PCs both render colours differently, as do browsers. You should use ‘web smart’ colours to minimise issues.

9.    Clashing colours. Nobody wants to read green text on a bright red background. Avoid bad colour combinations.

10.    Branding. Make sure you consider brand guidelines and use matching or complementary colours throughout your website.

11.    Take extra care when using light text on dark backgrounds. Not recommended for publishers, but it works for some websites. Here, you should increase the leading, tracking and decrease the font weight. Why? Because there is greater contrast with white on black, compared to black on white. But for news sites and blogs with lots of content, this doesn’t work so well.

12.    Use gradients and shadows. Ok, this is a bit Web 2.0-ish, but it works. I’ve seen websites relaunch with barely anything changed except the addition of some sexy gradients, or a drop shadow below the logo. This can add a lot of depth to a site, making it appear less 2D.

13.    Consider some colour coding. I love the brashness of colour in the navigation of the new Guardian website – they have ripped up the rulebook somewhat, but then we don’t do rules, do we? The typography works, and there’s plenty of white space on these colour-coded channels. It is a stand-out example, and shows how well this can work. It’s not just about colouring up channels: note how Techcrunch authors have their comments colour-coded when replying to reader comments.

14.    Try a little opacity. If you insist on using patterns, or placing text in front of images, try reducing the opacity of the background pattern (or part of the image where the text is placed) to lighten the colours. This will achieve greater contrast for the text in the foreground.

15.    Use richer colours for prominent items. My favourite buy-it-now button is bright red, placed against a white background.

16.    Avoid fluorescent craziness. This is the web, dammit, not a Stabilo Boss catalogue.

17.    Remember the role of images. Pictures can add a lot of colour and depth to web pages. Keep this in mind when working on the wireframes / early designs of a website, as if you’re using test content (‘Lorem Ipsum’) you won’t necessarily factor in images. Don’t overcompensate with colour at this early stage.

18.    Going global? Where do your existing and prospective customers live? Which market are you targeting? There are plenty of cultural considerations to factor in when choosing colours.

19.    Demographics. If your audience is elderly then some usability experts suggest that brighter colours may be a good idea. On the other hand, if your website is mainly used by children then you could introduce lighter shades and pastels.

20.    Does it fit? Green is for the environment. Pink is for maternity leave. Blue is for corporate sites, etc. I’m not sure these observations are anything more than generalisations, but an eco-friendly site heavy on hot pink might look a little bit odd.
