#Architecture of Gonnamake


##Ideas behind making gonnamake
We want to use it for ourselves and give the world. If they like to use it 

###Very lossly coupled.
Frameworks should be like a Framework. We should support the user to add there own methods and there own way to make the system.

###Why I stopped using other frameworks?
I have worked with many frameworks. Foundation Zurb, Twitter Bootstap, Kickstart and many others. I know Sass and LESS. I would vote for Sass for many reason. I like Foundation Zurb but used Bootstrap more than anything.

For all those who think like

This is my reaction.

[5 reasons not to use bootstrap](http://www.zingdesign.com/5-reasons-not-to-use-twitter-bootstrap/)
I agree with the above post. But the problem is not just with bootstrap it's with every framework.

### Why use gonnamake?
Consider Mac OS X, Ubuntu, Fedora and CentOS. They are work based on linux kernel.
Gonnamake is like linux. Which has various themes sitting on top of it.

We are first lauching with Flat UI.

###What we like is what we want!


While making a simple web page you don't want it to have a framework. But you want to have standard normalization and you need to have modernizer to run it. You want noting else.

    Sometime you might just need a grid system nothing else.

I need to use a cool webframework for my new project but when I start using them my website is similar to thousands of website. Ofcourse I customized and I found market place for that framework. 

    I want a framework to be as a design which like.

I don't want to waste my time on frameworks and finally get this reaction from my client.

##Basics

Colors and typography are the keys to any webpage. Sometimes amazing logo defines the beauty of the entire wesite.

###Color

In gonnamake the first thing we focused is on colors. It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors. But we don't use all of them in webdesign.

Palette of the colors differs by type of design.
We provide 1500+ colors which can be customizable.

###Typography
Typography is everything in an amazing framwork.

We donâ€™t make aesthetic design choices, but define proper markup with extensible styling for common typographic patterns.

###Grid
Organization of elements in a proper way is done in home. But how your mom organise differ from programmer organises.

Moms are the best organizers.

We are inspired by 2 grid systems. 1) Zurb Foundation and 2) Pure CSS by Yahoo!.

Both of them are amazing. But when we compare both are completely different. Pure CSS is how programmers organize stuff. and Zurb Foundation is how moms organize.

But, What if moms are programmers that is what Gonnamake grid is but it will confuse beginners.

So, We let the developers choose what they prefer for there project.


###Components
In addition to this we provide with:

+ Buttons
+ Forms
+ Images
+ Many more...

## Cool things:

By the designers for the designers.
